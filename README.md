The project involves understanding and implementing the following concepts:

Python packages
AirBnB clone
Command-line interpreter
Serialization and deserialization
File storage
Learning Objectives
By the end of the project, you are expected to:

Create a Python package
Develop a command interpreter using the cmd module
Implement unit testing in a large project
